  \begin{itemize}
    \item no clear winner \textrightarrow{} every method can be improved
    \item U2F is the most secure, but not usable enough for broad adoption
    \item different expectations (security vs. comfort)
    \item depending on application and user preferences
  \end{itemize}

  \note{
    \begin{itemize}
      \item pregenerated codes are relatively insecure but not that complicated to use
      \item push notifications are generally fast and often the usability is quite good. However the experience of different users varied greatly
      \item SMS messages as a 2FA method are still the most widespread, even though they are also the most insecure.
        \begin{itemize}
          \item tend to be slow and error prone in usage
          \item still in usage because of reluctance to change old 2FA methods
        \end{itemize}
      \item TOTP ranks quite good in terms of usability, even though the time to authenticate was quite high
      \item last but not least, while Universal 2nd Factor was designed to be secure and convenient, users were not quite satisfied with the day-to-day usability of security tokens
    \end{itemize}
